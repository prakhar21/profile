Greetings visitor,

My name is Prakhar Mishra. I am currently working as a **Data Engineer** in a Bangalore based Big Data start-up [FORMCEPT Technologies](http://www.formcept.com). My [typical day at work](day-at-work) goes in contributing to many tasks, majorly focusing on NLP, Text Analytics and Algorithms.


Let's **connect** on ***prakhar.mishra@formcept.com*** to discuss opportunities that we can have for one another.
