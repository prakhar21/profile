Greetings visitor,

My name is Prakhar Mishra. I am currently working as a **Data Engineer** in a Bangalore based Big Data start-up [FORMCEPT Technologies](http://www.formcept.com). My [typical day at work](day-at-work) goes in contributing to many tasks, majorly focusing on NLP, Text Analytics and Algorithms. 

After the office hours, I read domain related books because I strongly believe that every book adds something to your existing belief.


If, you are anxious to know more  about me, below questions will surely help.
- What [qualification](coursework) do you hold ?
- List your top [projects](projects) ?
- Any [achievements](achievements) other than academics ?

Impressed ? 
Let's **connect** on ***prakhar.mishra@formcept.com*** to discuss opportunities that we may have for one another.
