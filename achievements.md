### [](#header-3)Jaipur Hackathon

This was the first ever hackathon to be organised in Jaipur and believe it or not, we stood at first place out of 20 teams. It was a 24Hr event in which we had built a 2-D video game using **Unity3D** game engine and used **Kinect** to give it a gesture control feature.
